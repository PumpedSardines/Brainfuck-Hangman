  Readline code for entering the word to play with

  since i didn't want to write boolean logic i used this site:

  [ https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck_algorithms#x_.3D_x_-_y ]

  For many functions

  This file is a bit all over the place...
  Was developed over time, and i don't remember how it works.
  These comments are wrong
